# I. Load library & datasets
## 1. Libraries
```{r library, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) # main function, manipulate data
library(lubridate) # date format
library(gridExtra) # grid.arrange() to print many plots together in a same page
library(reshape2) # Data transformation
library(ggrepel) # For displaying plot's labels outside of the chart
library(wesanderson) # Wes Anderson color palette for plots
library(scales) # For percent()
```


\newpage
## 2. Load datasets
Required information
- Daily data of activity and sleep    
- Hourly data: steps, intensities, calories   
- Weight information   
```{r load_data} 
raw_daily_activity <- read.csv("datasets/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
raw_daily_sleep <- read.csv("datasets/sleepDay_merged.csv")

raw_hourly_steps <- read.csv("datasets/hourlySteps_merged.csv")
raw_hourly_intensities <- read.csv("datasets/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
raw_hourly_calories <- read.csv("datasets/hourlyCalories_merged.csv")

raw_weight_log <- read.csv("datasets/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```


\newpage
# II. Data cleaning
The data is not yet cleaned, by observing the data, we will determine the place that we need to clean   

## 1. Merge data
Hourly group has 3 datasets, based on observation, we can see that all of them have the matched information and data collected time,
therefore, we will merge all of these 3 hourly datasets into 1 single to make the analysis process more convenient.   
```{r clean_merge, warning = FALSE,}
# Left join hourly data together by Id and ActivityHour
hourly_activity <- raw_hourly_steps %>%
  left_join(raw_hourly_calories, by = c("Id","ActivityHour")) %>%
  left_join(raw_hourly_intensities, by = c("Id","ActivityHour"))

# Convert the date format of ActivityHour in to mdy_hms
hourly_activity <- hourly_activity %>%
  mutate(ActivityHour = mdy_hms(ActivityHour))

# Seperate ActivityHour into Date and Hour
hourly_activity <- hourly_activity %>%
  separate(
    ActivityHour, into = c("ActivityDate", "Hour"), sep= " "
  )
```

\newpage
## 2. Date format cleaning
- In the ***Daily activity*** dataset, we will change the date in to the Month-Day-Year format.
- In the ***Hourly activity***, we will convert all of time format into Month-Day-Year, Hour-Minute-Second.
- In ***Daily sleep***, because the time was collected with both date and hour, we will divide them
into 2 different variables for easier analysis. 

```{r clean_date, warning = FALSE}
# Convert date format
raw_daily_activity$ActivityDate <- mdy(raw_daily_activity$ActivityDate)

# Separate data and hour
daily_sleep <- raw_daily_sleep %>%
    separate(SleepDay, into = c("ActivityDate", "Hour"), sep= " ") %>%
    mutate(ActivityDate = mdy(ActivityDate)) %>%
    select(-Hour)

# Refine date & time format
hourly_activity <- hourly_activity %>%
  mutate(
    Hour = ifelse(is.na(Hour), "00:00:00",Hour),
    ActivityDate = ymd(ActivityDate)
  )
```

Let's take a brief look at the data after merging and date formatting
```{r clean_date_preview}
head(raw_daily_activity)
head(daily_sleep)
head(hourly_activity)
```

\newpage
## 3. Check for NAs and duplicates

### Take a look at the duplicates
```{r clean_dup_sum}
# Look for duplicates in raw_daily_activity
sum(duplicated(raw_daily_activity))
# Look for duplicates in daily_sleep
sum(duplicated(daily_sleep))
# Look for duplicates in hourly_activity
sum(duplicated(hourly_activity))
```

Take a look at the duplicates in `daily_sleep` and `hourly_activity` dataset
```{r clean_dup_observe}
daily_sleep[duplicated(daily_sleep),]
head(hourly_activity[duplicated(hourly_activity),],10)
```

Observation shows that `daily_sleep` duplicates are not actually duplications (each observation shows differences), therefore, we only remove the detected duplication 
in the `hourly_activity` dataset.

### Remove duplications
```{r clean_dup_clean}
# Choose only distinct observation
hourly_activity <- distinct(hourly_activity)
```

### Take a look at the NA
```{r clean_na_observe}
any(is.na(raw_daily_activity))
any(is.na(daily_sleep))
any(is.na(hourly_activity))
```
There was no NA value left in 3 datasets.   

\newpage
## 4. Add weekdays into the datasets
In later analysis, we will compared the collected data in each weekday, therefore, adding their names into the datasets
is required.   
```{r clean_weekdays}
daily_activity <- raw_daily_activity %>% 
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(ActivityDate)) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday = factor(weekday, 
    levels = c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday')
    )
  ) 

daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>% 
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(ActivityDate)) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday = factor(weekday, 
    levels = c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday')
    )
  ) 

hourly_activity <- hourly_activity %>% 
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(ActivityDate)) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday = factor(weekday, 
    levels = c('Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday')
    )
  )
```

```{r clean_weekdays_preview, echo = FALSE}
head(daily_activity)
head(daily_sleep)
head(hourly_activity)
```

\newpage
## 5. Remove unnecessary variables
In `daily_acitivity` dataset, `TrackerDistance` and `LoggedActivitiesDistance` are not needed as well as `AverageIntensity` in
`hourly_activity`. Therefore, they will be removed.
```{r clean_remove_var}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  select(
    -c(
      TrackerDistance,
      LoggedActivitiesDistance
    )
  )

hourly_activity <- hourly_activity %>%
  select(
    -c(
      AverageIntensity
    )
  )
```

## 6. Clean variable name
Convert the names of the variables into a desired format
```{r clean_var_name}
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  rename(
    "id" = Id,
    "date" = ActivityDate,
    "total_step" = TotalSteps,
    "total_dist" = TotalDistance,
    "very_active_dist" = VeryActiveDistance,
    "moderate_active_dist" = ModeratelyActiveDistance,
    "light_active_dist" = LightActiveDistance,
    "seden_active_dist" = SedentaryActiveDistance,
    "very_active_min" = VeryActiveMinutes,
    "moderate_active_min" = FairlyActiveMinutes,
    "light_active_min" = LightlyActiveMinutes,
    "seden_active_min" = SedentaryMinutes,
    "calories" = Calories
  )

daily_sleep <- daily_sleep %>%
  rename(
    "id" = Id,
    "date" = ActivityDate,
    "sleep_record" = TotalSleepRecords,
    "asleep_min" = TotalMinutesAsleep,
    "in_bed_min" = TotalTimeInBed
  )

hourly_activity <- hourly_activity %>%
  rename(
    "id" = Id,
    "date" = ActivityDate,
    "hour" = Hour,
    "total_step" = StepTotal,
    "calories" = Calories,
    "total_intensity" = TotalIntensity
  )
```

\newpage
## 7. Final datasets
```{r clean_final, echo = FALSE}
head(daily_activity)
head(daily_sleep)
head(hourly_activity)

# IV. Summarize data statistics
## 1. Number of records in each dataset
```{r summary_id}
daily_activity_distinct_id = n_distinct(daily_activity$id)
daily_sleep_distinct_id = n_distinct(daily_sleep$id)
hourly_activity_distinct_id = n_distinct(hourly_activity$id)

daily_activity_distinct_id
daily_sleep_distinct_id
hourly_activity_distinct_id
```
There are 35 distinct users in activity dataset, while only 24 users in daily sleep data. 

## 2. Statistical summaries
### A. Daily activity
```{r summary_daily_activity}
daily_activity %>%
  mutate(id = as.factor((id))) %>%
  summary()
```
**Insights**   
- Users took 7281 steps or 5,2 km daily in average. 
Which are considered to be [low active for an average adult](https://www.10000steps.org.au/articles/healthy-lifestyles/counting-steps/).   
- Light activity was recorded in most of the time & distance travelled (285 mins and 3.2km average)   

### B. Daily sleep
```{r summary_daily_sleep}
daily_sleep %>%
  mutate(id = as.factor((id))) %>%
  summary()
```
**Insights**   
- User sleeps 520 mins daily ~ 7 hours a day   
- Max sleeping time recored to be 796 mins ~ 13 hours in a single day      

### C. Hourly activity
```{r summary_hourly_activity}
hourly_activity %>%
  mutate(id = as.factor((id))) %>%
  summary()
```
**Insights**   
- The significant difference between the max value of `total_step`, `calories` and `total_intensity` suggests that 
there are possibly a group of users that are far more active compared to the average users   


\newpage
# V. Exploratory Descriptive Analysis (EDA) - by each dataset
## 1. Daily activity
### A. Determine using frequency
The data possess users usage data of a period of 62 days. We will divide the users into different categories 
based on their device total using day:   
- 0-12 days: Rarely   
- 13-30 days: Sometimes   
- 31-46 days: Often   
- 47-61 days: Usually   
- 62 days: Always   
Note: The frequency table is based on [Reverso dictionary](https://grammar.reverso.net/frequency/)
```{r group_use_freq}
# Determine total using day and usage frequency of each ID
freq_count <- daily_activity %>%
  group_by(id)%>%
  summarize(
    total_using_day = n_distinct(date)
  )%>%
  mutate(
    usage_frequency = case_when(
      0 < total_using_day & total_using_day < 13 ~ "Rarely",
      13 <= total_using_day & total_using_day < 31 ~ "Sometimes",
      31 <= total_using_day & total_using_day  < 47 ~ "Often",
      47 <= total_using_day & total_using_day < 62 ~ "Usually",
      total_using_day == 62 ~ "Always"
    ),
    usage_frequency = factor(
      usage_frequency, 
      levels = c(
        "Rarely",
        "Sometimes",
        "Often",
        "Usually",
        "Always"
      )
    )
  )

# Determine the number of user in each usage frequency
freq_count %>%
  group_by(usage_frequency)%>%
  count()
```

Using frequency
- Rarely use users (2 people, 1-30% of 62 days)    
- Sometimes use users (2 people, 30-49% of 62 days)    
- Often use users (28 people, 50-79% of 62 days)    
- Usually use users (2 people, 80-99% of 62 days)   
- Always use users (1 people, 100% of 62 days)

- On average, 82% of the time was spent in sedentary while people only active in 18% daily.   
- When in active, only 20 minutes of the day are used for very active activities, 13 for moderate activities while light active 
activities take 185 mins (3 hours 5 mins).   

The tracker's main feature is to measure the ***total steps taken***, therefore we can assume that their is always a strong 
positive relationship between ***total steps taken*** and the ***total distance travelled/ total calories burned***.

```

From the plot, we can clearly see that there is:   
- A strong relationship between total steps taken and light active distance/time   
- A insignificant relationshop between total steps taken and moderate/very active distance/time   
   
The plots show that most of the customers spend time walk lightly everyday and most of their steps are taken in low intensity. 
This information suggests that the customers mainly are normal people/workers. Moreover, the relationship between total steps taken and moderate/very 
active distance proves that they may still take daily walk or other moving exercises.

```
   
Aside from working days, when people are active overally, it is noticable that:   
- A significant larger amount of steps on Saturday: Possibly due to users usually spend more time outside, which may leads to more steps taken   
- A large drop on steps taken on Sunday: Could be a day off in the week when people spend most of the time rest/indoor.   
- People are likely to take more steps in the weekend (there is a considerable amount of people having more than 20k steps).

## 2. Daily sleep
### A. Take a look at the means of the variable
```{r analysis_day_sleep_mean}
options(scipen = 999)

daily_sleep %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  select(-c(id,weekday, date, sleep_record))%>%
  summarize_all(mean)
```
   
Average time asleep for a day is 420 minutes ~ 7 hours while, 
average time in bed of the participants is 459 minutes ~ 7 hour 39 mins. 
This means that aside from sleep, people spend another 39 minutes on average in bed.

\newpage
### B. Correlation: Relationship between total minute asleep vs total time in bed
```{r analysis_day_sleep_compare_assleep_inbed}
daily_sleep %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = asleep_min,
      y = in_bed_min,

    y = "Total time in bed",
    color = "Asleep time",
    title = "The relationship between the time in bed and time asleep"

```
   
From the graph, we can see the relationship between total time asleep and time in bed, 
this shows that participants are likely to..sleep when they are in bed (and not do other activities).

Observing the plot, it's noticable that:   
- The average sleep time daily is always more than 400 minutes (6 hours 40 mins).   
- People always spend an extra of 30-50 mins in bed without sleep.   
- On Sunday, the participants' sleeping time is longest with an average of 503 mins ~ 8.4 hourse in bed 
and 452 mins ~ 7 hours 32 mins sleep.

- Participants are active from 7:00 to 21:00 daily, with 2 intensive points at from 12:00 to 14:00 and 17:00 to 19:00.   
- On Saturday and Sunday, there is a trend of move less at the evening.   
- These 2 time periods are all meal time (while the latter is the getting off work time, 
workouts and also people may move more to prepare for their dinner).   
- At the weekend, people are usually start their days later but move less in the evening 
and still having the same rest time at the end of the day.   
- The heat maps suggest the active pattern of normal office workers

# VI. EDA - by dividing users into groups
## Adding user segmentation by steps and using frequency
We will divide the users into 3 groups:

- There are more steps during meal time (around noon, from 18-19h).   
- There is a difference between step pattern of weekdays and the weekend. People tend to walk in a shorter 
time range in the weekend.   
- Traces show that users in this group also walk during late night.    
- There is no clear step pattern observed. This may suggests that the 
users did not have a solid active schedule, and the time varies randomly.

### Average total device using days in the whole period
The data possess users usage data of a period of 62 days. We will divide the users into different categories 
based on their device total using day:   
- 0-12 days: Rarely   
- 13-30 days: Sometimes   
- 31-46 days: Often   
- 47-61 days: Usually   
- 62 days: Always   
Note: The frequency table is based on [Reverso dictionary](https://grammar.reverso.net/frequency/)

- The heatmap seems to have a clearer step pattern. Users tend to starts their walk from 
6:00 daily and rest before midnight.   
- During weekdays, it visible that users walk more during meal time (12-13h and 18-19h).   
- In the weekend, the starting time, however, is later at around 8:00.

# VII. Conclusion
**1. Users**
- Device usage frequency: By tracking the device total using days in the periods, most users are considered as 
'Often' users.
  - 28 people (80%) are 'Often' users
  - Even based on different steps taking user groups, the average device total using days 
  is still in the 'Often' frequency range.   

- User grouping: Most users take less than 10,000 steps daily 
(from around 4k to 7k steps daily). This shows that most users are normal adults who don't 
have intesive working/training schedule.   
  - Group 1: Users were active in an disordered schedule. Have least walking steps, travel distance 
  and active time. Adults who are not very active and are not exercising frequently.   
  - Group 2: Users were active in a more ordered schedule. Have a decent number of steps daily 
  at around. Adults but tends to workout frequently and more active compared to G1.   
  - Group 3: Most active users. Possesses extremely intensive activity stats. 
  Adults who always walk/exercising.


**2. Daily active time distribution**
- People spend most of their time (82%) sedentary, 18% active.   
- In active time, most of the time are for light activities (84% of active time). 
- High intensity % calories burnt observed during 17-19h on weekdays, this suggests that users usually workout 
during this time period. Similar insights can be found on Saturday morning.       
- Significantly high steps count are found on weekends and on meal time.    


**4. Distribution in a week**
- Similar activities in weekdays   
- Usually higher activities on Saturday   
- Less active on Sunday   


**5. Sleep**
- People sleep more on weekends.   
- 9% of the time in bed are not for sleep, this suggest that they may do other activities 
such as watching TV, using mobile phones, reading, ...    



# VIII. Suggestions
• Provide new tracking modes for different types of activities.       
• High amount of time not wearing the tracker shows that users may not feel comfortable with the design and consider.   
• Create different user profiles, features for different user groups from less active to very active users.   
• Aside from sedentary activities, create new feature for light activities as it takes 84% of all the average activities in a day.   
• Create a guide or an auto-bot to as an assistant to help reminding, scheduling and reporting.   
• Provide health reports.   
• Day-end report: people usually spend some time to relax, restless before sleep, so we can provide a report of their health status during the day.   
• Week-end report on Sunday when people usually spend their time to rest, be less active and may want to take a look of what had happened through out the week.   
• Encourage users to be more active by adding:   
  • Reward system: game or an experience count system with level-up mechanism.   
  • Notifications: regular reminds customers to encourage them to be more active.
